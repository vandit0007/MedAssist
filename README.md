Healthcare accessibility and proper medical guidance are critical challenges in today's world. 
Many patients struggle to identify which medical specialist to consult based on their symptoms, 
leading to delayed treatment and misdirected appointments.

This project presents an AI-powered Medical Chatbot for Symptom Analysis that Advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze patient symptoms and 
recommend appropriate medical departments. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
to understand patient descriptions and employs similarity matching algorithms to provide 
accurate department recommendations.

The chatbot serves as an intelligent triage system, helping patients make informed decisions 
about their healthcare while reducing the burden on medical facilities through proper 
appointment channeling.
